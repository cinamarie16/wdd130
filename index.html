        <p>Hello! My name is Lucina Huff and I live in Orem, UT.
            My husband and I have been married for 19 wonderful years.
            We have two girls: 11 and almost 16. (She's a great driver!)
            I'm an indie fantasy author with four published books and four works in progress.
            I also love to watch Chinese dramas. They're my current favorite type of TV show.
            I'm a proud indie author that loves fantasy and romance. I have four published books
            and four works in progress. I was born and raised in the stunning and diverse PNW city
            of Tacoma, WA. Since marrying my own handsome prince charming, I have lived in more places than I
            care to count. I'm a stay-at-home mom of two spunky girls. I had two dreams while growing up:
            to be a mother and to be an author. I'm pleased to be living both my dreams. My hobbies include
            (but are not limited to): crocheting, playing the piano, chainmaille jewelry making, and
            bingeing all the stories.
        </p>
