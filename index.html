        <p>Hello! My name is Lucina Huff and I live in Orem, UT.
            My husband and I have been married for 19 wonderful years.
            We have two girls: 11 and almost 16. (She's a great driver!)
            I'm an indie fantasy author with four published books and four works in progress.
            I also love to watch Chinese dramas. They're my current favorite type of TV show.
        </p>
